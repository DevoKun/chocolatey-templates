=========

## In May 2014 the anonymous developers of TrueCrypt stopped working on the project
* The anonymous developers of the original TrueCrypt decided to stop working on TrueCrypt and took down their truecrypt.org website.

## Why use TrueCrypt 7.1a? What about TrueCrypt 7.2?
* Truecrypt 7.2 is a neutered version with all encryption functionality removed.

## Is TrueCrypt still safe to use?
* Truecrypt 7.1a is still safe to use (https://www.grc.com/misc/truecrypt/truecrypt.htm).

* If you see messages about TrueCrypt being unsafe to use, it's ONLY because TrueCrypt, for now, is unmaintained.
* If a security issue is discovered there are no official developers around to fix it.
* TrueCryptNext is working to organize the future of TrueCrypt.
